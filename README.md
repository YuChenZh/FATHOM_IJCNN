# Federated Multi-task Learning with Hierarchical Attention for Sensor Data Analytics 

A hierarchical attention model for device sensor data analytics. Task-specific attention at each device is developed to evaluate personal feature correlations, a temporal global attention layer on shared representations is created to evaluate cross-device temporal correlations.
